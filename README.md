### **Problem Statement:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs make up a large portion of the market - almost 2/3 of the global market - which is worth about \$3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trillion USD.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In India, SMEs count for 6-6% of the manufacturing GDP and about 25% of Service Sector GDP. They are also &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the largest source of employment, as a collective, employing about 106 million people - 40% of India's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They form an integral part of the country's economy and are thus closely tied with the growth and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress of India as a nation. This makes problems faced by SMEs a collective issue that affects the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economy, growth and wellbeing of the country and it's people.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that we identified as one of the most important, one that causes many SMEs to fade away into &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obscurity is cash flow management. Our product **CredBlock** aims to resolve this situation by applying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blockchain technology and its paradigms.
