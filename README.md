### **Problem Statement:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs make up a large portion of the market - almost 2/3 of the global market - which is worth about \$3 trillion USD.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In India, SMEs count for 6-7% of the manufacturing GDP and about 25% of Service Sector GDP. They are also the<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; largest source of employment, as a collective, employing about 106 million people - 40% of India's workforce.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They form an integral part of the country's economy and are thus closely tied with the growth and progress of India as<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a  nation. This makes problems faced by SMEs a collective issue that affects the economy, growth and wellbeing of the <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country and it's people.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem that we identified as one of the most important, one that causes many SMEs to fade away into obscurity is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cash flow management.

### **Our Solution:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our solution was to create a Smart Contract(Blockchain) based product. We aimed to connect buyers, seller and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; investors, in a common marketplace. In the marketplace, buyers (Core Enterprises - large corporations eg: Reliance, Tata<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motors etc.) can source requirements from SMEs without having to compromise the cash flow.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Detail:
1) The buyer will raise a request to a specific SME when required.<br/>

2)  The sellar can understant the buyer's requirements and  based on that can specify the amount of  working capital and working capital deadline. <br>

3) The buyer has the option to specify the percent of insurance that will be backed by their side in case of anything default by the sellar.

4) After the final approval by the buyer's side, the contract will be visible to the investors along with the previous statstical data of the buyer and seller.
