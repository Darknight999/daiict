### **Problem Statement:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs make up a large portion of the market - almost 2/3 of the global market - which is worth about \$3 trillion USD.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In India, SMEs count for 6-7% of the manufacturing GDP and about 25% of Service Sector GDP. They are also the<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; largest source of employment, as a collective, employing about 106 million people - 40% of India's workforce.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They form an integral part of the country's economy and are thus closely tied with the growth and progress of India as<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a  nation. This makes problems faced by SMEs a collective issue that affects the economy, growth and wellbeing of the <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country and it's people.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem that we identified as one of the most important, one that causes many SMEs to fade away into obscurity is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cash flow management. Our product **CredBlock** aims to resolve this situation by applying blockchain technology and its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paradigms.

### **Our Solution:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our solution was to create a Smart Contract(Blockchain) based product. We aimed to connect buyers, seller and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; investors, in a common marketplace. In the marketplace, buyers (Core Enterprises - large corporations eg: Reliance, Tata<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motors etc.) can source requirements from SMEs without having to compromise the cash flow.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Detail:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) The buyer will raise a request to a specific SME when required.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <br/>
