# **Smart Contracts Module - Blockchain**

**_Deployed on Matic TestNet_**

## **Blockchain:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A block chain is a distributed, time-stamped, immutable ledger of data that can be used to store virtually anything. <br/>

## **Smart Contracts:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart contracts are computer protocols that are designed to digitally facillitate and enforce the negotiation and<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fulfillment of contracts between two independent parties, without the involvement or influence of third parties. These &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contribute to make it faster, cheaper and more secure than its more traditional alternatives.

## **Smart Contracts in Our Product:**
- We used Smart Contracts to create an immutable, distributed ledger of records to promote trust.
- A dedicated wallet and token system was created using smart contracts, with us - the product creators -  as the banker to ensure hassle free escrow transactions for our customers.
