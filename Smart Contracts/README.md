# **Smart Contracts Module - Blockchain**

**_Deployed on Matic TestNet_**

## **Blockchain:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A block chain is a distributed, time-stamped, immutable ledger of data that can be used to store virtually &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anything. <br/>

## **Smart Contracts:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart contracts are computer protocols that are designed to digitally facillitate and enforce the negotiation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fulfillment of contracts between two independent parties, without the involvement or influence of third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties.
These contribute to make it faster, cheaper and more secure than its more traditional alternatives.
